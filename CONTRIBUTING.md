# CONTRIBUTING
First, thank you for your contribution. There is just one point, you should follow (for now):
## Format Commit Messages
The messages should be prefixed with:
- `website:` if the changes affect the `website/` directory,
- `cli:` if the changes affect anything in the `cli/` directory,
- `server:` if the changes affect the `server/` direcotry,
- `doc:` if the changes affect anything else, eg. the README, or the Dockerfile.
Here are some examples:
- `doc: Fixed typo in README.md`
- `server: updated dependency`
If necessary, more prefixes can also be used, but I ask you, to **NOT DO IT LIKE THIS**:
- `website, cli: FIxed sth`
